\hline
 expID & An ID that uniquely identifies the experiment instance \\ \hline
 user & The participant's email address \\ \hline
 userID & The participant's unique ID \\ \hline
 taskID & The experiment task ID undertaken by the participant \\ \hline
 time & The time taken by the participant to complete the task \\ \hline
 mental & The mental demand of the task, the answer to the question ``How much mental and perceptual activity was required (e.g., thinking, deciding, calculating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)? Was the task easy (low mental demand) or complex (high mental demand)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
 temporal & The temporal demand, the answer to the question ``How much time pressure did you feel due to the rate or pace at which the tasks or task elements occurred? Was the pace slow and leisurely (low temporal demand) or rapid and frantic (high temporal demand)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100\\ \hline
psychological & The frustration felt while  completing the task, the answer to the question ``How secure, gratified, content, relaxed and complacent (low psychological stress) versus insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed and annoyed (high psychological stress) did you feel during the task?'' \\ \hline
 performance & The effort expended completing the task, the answer to the question ``How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goal of the task? How satisfied were you with your performance in accomplishing the goal?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
 effort & The effort expended completing the task, the answer to the question ``How much conscious mental effort or concentration was required? Was the task almost automatic (low effort) or it required total attention (high effort)?''on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
central & The answer to the question ``How much attention was required for activities like remembering, problem-solving, decision-making and per- ceiving (eg. detecting, recognizing and identifying objects)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
response & The answer to the question ``How much attention was required for selecting the proper response channel and its execution?(manual - key- board/mouse, or speech - voice)'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
 visual & The effort expended completing the task, the answer to the question ``How much attention was required for executing the task based on the information visually received (through eyes)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
 auditory & The effort expended completing the task, the answer to the question ``How much attention was required for executing the task based on the information auditorily received (ears)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline

spatial & Spatial workload, the answer to the question ``How much attention was required for spatial processing (spatially pay attention around you)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
verbal & Verbal workload, the answer to the question ``How much attention was required for verbal material (eg. reading or processing linguistic material or listening to verbal conversations)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
manual & Manual effort, the answer to the question ``How much attention was required for manually respond to the task (eg. keyboard/mouse usage)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
speech & The effort expended through speech, the answer to the question ``How much attention was required for producing the speech response(e.g. engaging in a conversation or talk or answering questions)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
arousal & The degree to which the participant was aroused, the answer to the question ``Were you aroused during the task? Were you sleepy, tired (low arousal) or fully awake and activated (high arousal)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
bias & The context bias, ``How often interruptions on the task occurred? Were distractions (mobile, questions, noise, etc.) not important (low context bias) or did they influence your task (high context bias)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
intention &  The effort expended completing the task, the answer to the question ``Were you motivated to complete the task?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
knowledge & The knowledge of the user before the experiment, the answer to the question ``How much experience do you have in performing the task or similar tasks on the same website?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
parallelism & The degree to which a user multi-tasked, the answer to the question ``Did you perform just this task (low parallelism) or were you doing other parallel tasks (high parallelism) (eg. multiple tabs/windows/programs)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
skill & The effect of the participants skill level on completing the task, the answer to the question ``Did your skills have no influence (low) or did they help to execute the task (high)?'' on a scale from 0 - 100 \\ \hline
difficulty & \( \frac{1}{8} \) ((solving/deciding) + (response) + (task/space) + (verbal material) + (visual resources) + (auditory resources) + (manual response) + (speech response)) \\ \hline
